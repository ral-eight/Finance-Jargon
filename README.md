Hello! I created this as a way for me to keep up with all the jargon I come across, whether it be in books or websites or WSJ.
I'm still actively updating this to accomodate to any new features I come up with while using it to log my progress.
Feel free to fork this and DIY your own Finance Dictionary! (Debating if I should keep this as Finance Dictionary or Finance Jargon hmm)
